AI4Green is a web-based application, available as open-source code and free to use. It offers the core functionality of an ELN, namely, the ability to store reactions securely and share them among different members of a research team. As users plan their reactions and record them in the ELN, green and sustainable chemistry is encouraged by automatically calculating green metrics and color-coding hazards, solvents, and reaction conditions. The interface links a database constructed from data extracted from PubChem, enabling the automatic collation of information for reactions. The application’s design facilitates the development of auxiliary sustainability applications, such as our Solvent Guide. As more reaction data are captured, subsequent work will include providing “intelligent” sustainability suggestions to the user.",University of Nottingham,The ELN was developed by Professor Jonathan Hirst's Research Group at the University of Nottingham,https://ai4green.app/,Active,Still in active development with regular releases,12/07/2024,"Role-based access,

ELN-25,Chemotion,"The Chemotion ELN was designed for chemists and adapted to the special requirements of chemical laboratory work and documentation. It therefore serves as a digitalization instrument for work in chemistry, developed to overcome the current limitations of the existing systems. To reach this goal, the development, improvement, and extension of the ELN is a community effort. The ELN is also used in other disciplines beyond chemistry as it offers a broad generic functionality to meet the needs of scientists working in interdisciplinary environments. These generic functions are still being extended and adapted.
Chemotion ELN offers a specific function that facilitates the publication of research data: it supports the transfer of data from a user's ELN account to a research data repository. This function reduces the scientists' effort in allowing access to research data, which is required by many funding agencies and helpful for the publication of scientific text publications. Currently, the ELN supports the transfer of data to the Chemotion repository.",Karlsruher Institut für Technologie (KIT),"The development of Chemotion started at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in the group of Prof. Stefan Bräse as part of a DFG-funded project. Currently, the ELN Chemotion is developed by several software developers at different NFDI4Chem sites at KIT, FSU Jena, TU Braunschweig, IPB Halle, and RWTH Aachen.

Besides the conventional ELN features (high-end text editor, experimental notes, dated entries, versioning & audit trail, import of images & documents, etc.) this ELN understands dataformats. Users can upload spectroscopic data from various vendors manually or automatically (e.g. NMR, EPR, UV/Vis, Raman, etc.) and LOGS-ELN will parse the format files, resulting in a searchable database of measurements, and the ability to display spectra within a built in spectrum viewer. Data can be linked and be displayed within the ELN seamlessly, via drag & drop functionality. This innovative combination results in the ability to document the complete data cycle for all research needs. By linking experimental protocols directly with measurement data, the experimental documentation lays the necessary ground work for a lab that conducts and saves data in a FAIR fashion. LOGS-ELN can be combined with LOGS-SDMS, a scientific data management system that is able to collect data from lab instruments automatically, and includes a sample database that keeps track of sample measurements, storage coordinates and linked media.",SIGNALS GmbH & Co KG,"Effectively now owned by Bruker as part of SciY, which is their software arm launched in June 2023.",https://logs.sciy.com/products,Inactive,"LOGS-ELN doesn't appear to be continued.

Keeping the raw scientific data at its source, e.g., on the hard disk of the researcher or the respective microscope, is one of the core principles of PASTA-ELN. The local storage of the data ensures its accessibility with conventional analysis software while maintaining its confidentiality and security. At the same time, an adaptive CouchDB document database is used to store metadata, including the hierarchical structure of the project.
PASTA-ELN extractor scripts process the raw measurement files while scanning the working directory. As a result, thumbnails, data, and metadata are automatically captured and integrated into the project. Scientists can create new or modify existing extractor scripts to tailor the data and metadata extraction to their needs.
In addition, PASTA-ELN facilitates seamless data exchange through a compatible (.eln) file format that conforms to the RO-Crate standard. This feature promotes effective archiving and migration of data and metadata across platforms, supporting collaboration and data interoperability.","Forschungszentrum Jülich, Institute Structure and Function of Materials (IEK-2)","The ELN is developed by Dr. Steffen Brinckmann at the Institute Structure and Function of Materials (IEK-2), Forschungszentrum Jülich.",https://github.com/PASTA-ELN/pasta-eln,Active,Github maintained. v2.6.0,26/07/2024,"Continuous maintenance,
